Bugs found:

1.
In CalDay.java
In method CalDay() ((The default constructor))

Line 43
    valid = true;
should be
    valid = false;

Code was detected by CalDayTest.java, assertion on line 22, where it would expect the default CalDay would not be valid because a day was not given, but it actually is valid (due to the bug).




2.
In Appt.java
In method isValid()

Line 113
        int NumDaysInMonth= CalendarUtil.NumDaysInMonth(startYear,startMonth);
should be
        int NumDaysInMonth= CalendarUtil.NumDaysInMonth(startYear,startMonth - 1);

Code was detected by ApptRandomTest.java, line 76 when a faulty Appt was created which generated a utility error from the Util file (CalUtil)

When a new Appt() was created, and the upper-bound testing of the month (when the month was set to 12), or was set to December, an error was produced. I found that the error was due to the fact that my partner incremented the month when making a system call to the calendar utility, which would result in an error when December was checked, and throw off all the other days of the month.

This function is inside the isValid function inside the Appt.java file. If you can recall, the CalendarUtil function accepts only input from 0-11.
